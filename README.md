About:
With a team of 3 build a fully functioning website, our website is a social site for people who enjoy LARPing(Live Action Role Play), where a user can create an account start a story where it can have many different events, and other users can join the event and cast for a avalible role.


Progress:
We started with a brain storm of website ideas, and took our time with the datebases, put ourselves in the shoes of the user, admin.  We got carried away with the ideas but it was amazing.  Because of the many objects one user can have to be apart of majority of our tables are interconnected, such as a user can create a story, one story can have many events which will have many users for many roles.  As we are building the entities we realized how many join tables we have and later in the controller building the problem came up, when creating a user sign up form we wanted such user to must have an address, a birthday(because we want out site to be 18 or older only) we end up have to build couple of DTO with duo entities fields.  I enjoyed that we planed ahead during this project, we didn't plan the project to meet the requirements, we plan the site as if we would put it in the real world therefore we must build certain things even thou we aren't implementing them right now.
